Check the Non heap memory issue :
      For Netty there is a buffer leak detection mechanism. Usually it tracks 1% of buffers.
 
        (Depending on Netty version, the spelling of the flag may differ a little):
        -Dio.netty.leakDetection.level=advanced
        Will let you know who accessed the leaked buffer last.
        To track all buffers, not just 1% (don’t use in production):
        -Dio.netty.leakDetection.level=paranoid
        One typical problem to look out for – if you read the request body as a stream, you need to ensure that you fully drain the stream and always close it. Depending on (bugs in) implementation, it may not be enough to just close it.

Command to capture the RSS and Heap
bash$ kubectl exec -it <container id> -c <container name> -n <namespace> -- bash -c "while(true); do jcmd 6 GC.heap_info && date && echo ------------- && sleep 2; done" | tee <file_loc>
 
bash$ kubectl exec -it <container id> -c <container name> -n <namespace> -- bash -c "while(true); do cat /sys/fs/cgroup/memory/memory.stat | grep rss && date && echo ------------- && sleep 2; done" | tee <file_loc>
